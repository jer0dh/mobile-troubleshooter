** Mobile Troubleshooter **

This was written to provide a quick way to obtain console.log output on mobile
devices where access to the development console is hard or not possible.

This creates a fixed window and redirects the console.log output to it.

This was also written for me to get a better feel of using browserfy, jasmine, and
MVC.
